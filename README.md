# LIBS-Data-Analysis

A standalone Windows application for Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) data analysis. This tool allows users to import, adjust, and analyze LIBS data, offering functionalities such as spectrum adjustment, plotting, and elemental line identification using a built-in periodic table.

## Features

- **Import Data**: Easily load your LIBS data for analysis.
- **Adjust Spectrum**: Normalize your data and apply various smoothing methods:
  - **Moving Average**
  - **Gaussian Filter**
  - **Savitzky-Golay Filter**
  - **Median Filter**
  - **Wavelet Transform**
- **Adjust Plot**: Customize plot appearance, including axis adjustments and line aesthetics.
- **Export**: Save your adjusted plots and data for further use or reporting.
- **Search Element**: A comprehensive module that provides a periodic table interface. Select elements, specify database sources, ionization levels, labeling preferences, and set thresholds for line identification.
- **Calibration-Free Module** (In Development): Aims to offer quantitative/calibration-free LIBS analysis. Note: This module requires a spectrometer with high resolution.
- **Acquisition Function** (In Development): Integration with the Ocean Optic spectrometer for simultaneous data acquisition and analysis.

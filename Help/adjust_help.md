**Help Section: Adjust Plot**

Welcome to the Adjust Plot help section. This section aims to guide you on how to use the features available in the Adjust Plot window.

**Tab 1: Axis Adjustment and Normalization**

In this tab, you can adjust the X-axis (wavelength) and Y-axis (relative intensity) of the plot.

**X-Axis (Wavelength)**

The X-axis of the plot represents the wavelength. In Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), each element in the sample produces a unique set of emission lines (wavelengths), allowing for element identification.

To adjust the X-axis of the plot, simply enter your desired minimum and maximum wavelengths in the appropriate fields and click apply.

**Y-Axis (Relative Intensity)**

The Y-axis of the plot represents the relative intensity of the emission. In LIBS, the intensity of the emission lines correlates with the abundance of the corresponding elements in the sample.

To adjust the Y-axis of the plot, enter your desired minimum and maximum relative intensities in the appropriate fields and click apply.

**Normalization**

Normalization is a crucial step in data preprocessing and analysis, especially in the context of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). It is a process that adjusts the measured values from different scales to a common scale.

In the context of your application, normalization adjusts the relative intensity values (Y-axis) of your spectral data such that they fall within a range between 0 and 1. This helps in ensuring that the relative intensities are comparable, thus allowing for easier interpretation and analysis of the data.

The purpose of normalization in LIBS data is multi-fold:

1.  **Easier Comparison:** Normalization allows for easier comparison between different elements or different samples. For instance, when you are comparing the LIBS spectra of two different samples, normalization can help you compare the relative intensities of spectral lines across the two samples more effectively.
2.  **Mitigate Influence of Extreme Values:** Without normalization, extreme values or outliers in your data can significantly influence your results. Normalization helps to mitigate this by bringing all values within a standard range.
3.  **Aiding in Visualization:** Normalized data can be more straightforward to visualize and interpret in a plot because all data will be in the same scale, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.
4.  **Improving Analytical Techniques:** Certain analytical techniques or algorithms (if applied to the data) require the data to be normalized to function correctly.

**Tab 2: Visual Adjustments**

This tab allows you to make visual adjustments to the plot.

**Line Color and Width**

You can adjust the color and width of the plot line. These adjustments help with the visualization of the plot, particularly when multiple lines are present or when presenting the plot.

**Plot Background Color**

You can also adjust the plot's background color. A contrasting background color can help make the plot lines stand out more clearly.

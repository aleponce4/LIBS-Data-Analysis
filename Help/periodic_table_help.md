# Periodic Table Window - Help Section

Welcome to the Help Section for the Periodic Table Window. This window allows you to interact with a visual representation of the periodic table to select elements for analysis in your LIBS data processing software. Please find explanations for the key features below:

Selectable Elements: Click on any element in the periodic table to select it for analysis. You can select up to 10 elements at a time to avoid overwhelming the program and plot with labels.

Database Selection: Choose from two databases using the dropdown menu:

1.  **Standard Database (NIST LIBS Database):** This comprehensive database is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and contains atomic and ionic spectral line data, including wavelengths, energy levels, and transition probabilities.
2.  **Persistent Lines Database (USA Army's Foundational Research Laboratory):** This database focuses on persistent or long-lived spectral lines\*, which remain visible for extended periods after the laser pulse. These lines can improve element identification accuracy and consistency in various conditions.

Persistent/Long-lived Lines**:**

Typically, the spectral lines appear immediately after the laser pulse and disappear soon after. However, some lines, known as persistent or long-lived lines, remain visible for a longer duration after the laser pulse. The longevity of these lines is due to the specific properties of the atomic transitions they represent.

Persistent lines offer several advantages in LIBS analysis. Firstly, they are less likely to be obscured by the noise and other effects that are prominent immediately after the laser pulse. Secondly, they can provide reliable data even in complex samples where other lines might be hidden by the spectral signatures of other elements or compounds. Lastly, their long visibility period allows more time for measurement, which can improve signal-to-noise ratios and overall accuracy of the measurement.

### Ionization Levels:

In atomic and molecular physics, ionization levels refer to the different energy levels that an electron can occupy in an atom or a molecule. When an atom is subjected to a high-energy laser pulse, as in LIBS, electrons are excited from their ground state (level 1) to higher energy states (levels 2, 3, etc.). When these excited electrons return to their lower energy states, they emit light at specific wavelengths, creating the spectral lines we see in LIBS.

By selecting to search only for peaks from ionization levels 1, 2, and 3, you are focusing on the most fundamental and easily identifiable transitions. These transitions are generally more robust and less likely to be affected by environmental factors, leading to more accurate and consistent results.

Focusing on these levels can also simplify your data. Higher ionization levels can produce a large number of spectral lines, some of which may overlap with lines from other elements. By limiting the ionization levels, you reduce the number of lines to consider, making it easier to identify and quantify the elements in your sample.
